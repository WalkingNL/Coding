## the order to execute a javascript program
### scripts are loaded
#### who and how does the action of loading scripts

- this action is done by explorers from HTMLs or some other external files

  ```HTML
  <script src="js/styles.js"></script>
  ```
- the loading time of java scripts

  scripts might be marked with different HTML attributes like `async` or `defer`, it affects **when** and **how** the script is executed.
  - `inline` scripts.

    execute as they are encountered
   
    ```HTML
    <!-- inline scripts -->
    <script src="js/styles.js"></script>
    ```
  
  - `async` scripts

    the script is executed asynchronously with the rest of the page. It does not block the parsing of the HTML document and will execute as soon as it is downloaded.

    ```HTML
    <!-- Asynchronous script loading -->
    <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-XXXXX-Y"></script>
    <script>
      window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
      function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
      gtag('js', new Date());
      gtag('config', 'UA-XXXXX-Y');
    </script>
    ```

  - `defer` scripts
 
    the script is executed after the HTML document has been fully parsed. It ensures that the script runs in the order they appear in the document.

    ```HTML
    <!-- Deferred script loading -->
    <script defer src="scripts/main.js"></script>
    ```

### scripts are parsed

  to change the js code into a structure called the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), this is done to analyze and understand the code structure. There are two tools that can be used to check the AST of a piece of js code, they are `the AST explorer` and `JavaScript AST Visualiser`.

### execution context are created
JavaScript creates execution contexts to keep track of what is running. The following contexts are key:
-	`Global Execution Context`: Created for code outside of any function. Variables and functions defined globally are stored here.
-	`Function Execution Contexts`: Created for each function when invoked.
-	`Eval Execution Context`: Created when the eval() function is called.

Each context goes through two phases:
1. Creation Phase:
- Hoisting:
  -	Variable declarations (var) and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope.
  -	Function expressions and let/const variables are not hoisted the same way.
- Memory allocation: Variables and functions are allocated memory.
- The `this` binding is determined.
- The scope chain is established.

2. Execution Phase:
	â€¢	Code is executed line by line, in the order it appears (post-hoisting).

### scripts are executed
#### synchronous code runs first, line by line
#### asynchronous code (callback, promises) is handled by the Event loop and processed later
#### microtasks (e.g., Promises) are executed before tasks (e.g., setTimeout)
